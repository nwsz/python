# 🚀 Python mini-project
A lot of people won't ever read this, and that's ok! I only published these here so that I don't need to store it on my own computer. Every one of these small projects is to help me improve my python skill for future development opportunities. Each one is based on a certain skill / aspect of python as to hone in on specific details. The projects are in correlation to what I have been studining similar to the time if not slightly delayed.

**Extra details:**
*IDE*: Visual Studio Code 2025 (VSCode)
*Language:* Python
Some projects were held on a private VPS for testing, but that's only for some that make it more useful to have.
You can view the attached github.io subdomain for a brief about each project, I will barely update that though.
